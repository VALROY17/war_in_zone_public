It's also worth considering which merchants you'll need to purchase it from (your merchant's inventory won't change!!!). The recruitment price for a soldier will also change after rearming, depending on the base price of ammunition. The cost of rearming depends on how many soldiers will be rearmed. If there aren't enough soldiers, rearming is free. Any previously used ammunition the soldiers had before rearming will be stored in the warehouse.
