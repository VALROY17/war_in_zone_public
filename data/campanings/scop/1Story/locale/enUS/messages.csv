[Groups.bandits.:main].Description;Bandits are the criminal element of the Zone. They control significant territories further south. Despite their favorable location, defending them won't be easy, as they are in conflict with virtually everyone. They lack adequate weapons and a large number of skilled soldiers within their ranks. The faction needs to reorganize, both internally and externally.
[Groups.bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;Well, what now, chump, had enough? Pull your piece out! The boys are already on their way!

[Groups.bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;Man, that was just pathetic as hell?

[Groups.bandits.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Defeat by event flag!
[Groups.bandits.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction's behavior soon became less and less like its original form. Yes, there was still crime, but it was diminishing. The elite tried to promote a theme close to that advocated by the ""Freedom"" faction, while the lower ranks were slow to embrace these new ideals, as the old methods of robbery and looting seemed simpler and more understandable. The group was splintering before our eyes. Every new day brought new instances of disobedience by individual groups. A new conflict in the Zone was about to begin..."
[Groups.bandits.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The gang's behavior soon became less and less like its original self. The criminal element diminished significantly. The leadership increasingly pushed the idea of ??fighting the Zone. Yes, many understood that there was no one left to rob, everyone was part of the faction, and they agreed. But since the gang also included real criminals, separate groups formed to rob those same ""their own."" Localized fighting broke out all around. The Zone once again found itself on the brink of a full-scale war of all against all..."
[Groups.bandits.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction's behavior soon became less and less like its original form. Crime levels dropped significantly. A strict hierarchy was established. The name ""Penal Battalion"" best described the situation. Rumors circulated among the faction's members that the top brass had caved in to the government's influence. Many accepted this, but there were also those in power with the ""big shots"" who disagreed with this arrangement. A new, large-scale conflict was brewing, this time within the group..."
[Groups.bandits.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The Zone had become a criminal quasi-state. The Zone began to live by its own rules. Soon, there was no one left to rob, and the gang became mired in infighting. Instead of shooting monsters and looting artifacts, the Bandits started shooting at each other...
[Groups.bandits.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The last bandit got the bullet. There's no more room for the criminal underworld in the Zone... Defeat!
[Groups.bandits.Crime].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up. The boys say you're no good... Defeat!
[Groups.bandits.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction controls the entire territory. There's no one left to rob. Soon, there'll be nowhere left to loot either... The top brass is already actively switching to lucrative contracts from the government. Groups of Scientists can now often be seen in the Zone taking their animal activity measurements under the watchful eye of local ""brothers."" Yesterday's bandits were already out and about, doing what they once considered too dirty - searching for artifacts, extracting mutant body parts, and taking obscure measurements with equally obscure instruments. Not everyone liked this, so isolated groups emerged who organized attacks on ""their own."" They tried to actively combat them, but more and more of these ""dissenters"" appeared, as few found their place in the new reality of studying the Zone..."

[Groups.bandits.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction controls the entire territory. There's no one left to rob. Soon, there will be no more room for looting either... The leadership is already actively switching to lucrative contracts from the outside world. But the emphasis was on more criminal contracts, so Scientists, guarded by local soldiers, were practically nonexistent in the Zone, significantly limiting exploration of the Zone. The government planned to launch several military operations to retake key Zone facilities. Soon there will be a ""War in the Zone"" again..."
[Groups.bandits.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! But despite the fact that the faction had occupied all territories, there was no such control over its forces. Confusion reigned all around. Strange speeches from the leadership, strange behavior from everyone in the northern Zone, the psionic installations soon being turned on again... All this worried those in the south. The south began arming itself and forming its own hierarchy with commanders. A new phase of the ""War in the Zone"" was about to begin..."
[Groups.bandits.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The group controls the entire territory. There's no one left to plunder. Soon, there will be no more room to loot either... The leadership is actively trying to find new ways to enrich themselves. The soldiers began to be divided into subgroups. Some search for artifacts, others hunt for mutant body parts, and still others are used as mercenaries to carry out external contracts. But there were also those for whom any of the ""peaceful"" trades were unsuitable. The first conflicts and subsequent fighting soon began. The group's internal hierarchy was in turmoil, and it was unclear how it would all end..."
[Groups.bandits.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The faction soon behaved less and less like its original self. Crime had truly diminished. Pay your share, and you can go and get artifacts. No one should interfere. And if someone does, they'll find those guys. Find them quickly. But if they find patrons high up, they'll let them go with a few words of warning. So, within the faction, separate groups with their own leaders quickly formed, dragging the group toward armed internal conflict...
[Groups.bandits.Unknow].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The Zone had become a criminal quasi-state. The Zone began to live by its own rules.

[Groups.bandits.Zombie].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Now O-Consciousness is safe. Soon, psi-radiation covered the entire Zone thanks to the increased number of emitters. Even the Cordon became dangerous. The government, although didn't release mutants from the Zone, no longer tried to retake it...

[Groups.Duty.:main].Name;Duty
[Groups.Duty.:main].Description;Duty. The faction's goal is to protect the world from the Zone's contagion. It's a fairly powerful paramilitary group. A favorable location, good weapons, and a predisposition to combat mutants guarantee success in capable hands.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;You and your gang are a threat to peace, it's time to deal with you!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;We want to make a truce with you, do you agree?
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;We propose an alliance. Together we can carry out a few operations against our enemies. Do you agree?
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;We will no longer cooperate!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;Got any extra cash? Times are tough here. We'd like this much:
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-0-Down;I see. We'll cleanse the Zone of you too!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;It's a pity, but since you insist, it will be so.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-No;No, we definitely won't do that now.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Yes;We look forward to further cooperation.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-No;No, we definitely won't do that now.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-Yes;Okay, great, deal!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-No;No, we can't help yet.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-Yes;Okay, we will help you.
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-No;Oh, it was a shame you refused!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-Yes;Good, that makes me happy!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-No;Oh, it was a shame you refused!
[Groups.Duty.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-Yes;Good, that makes me happy!

[Groups.Duty.:main].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. Defeat!
[Groups.Duty.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Defeat by event flag!
[Groups.Duty.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! It would seem the war is over. The Zone is controlled by a single faction. But not long ago, its ideology changed. And to one opposed by its founders. Even before the war ended, disagreements were brewing among the commanders. It seems a new ""War in the Zone"" is brewing, one that will be purely ideological..."
[Groups.Duty.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, Duty contacted the government and began collaborating. Mutants were eradicated, and scientists were sent to the Zone more and more frequently. Intelligence agents were increasingly spotted in Duty, but perhaps these were just rumors...
[Groups.Duty.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Lose;Your faction has been completely destroyed. The last of the Duty members have scattered, lacking the will to fight for the ideals of Duty. Defeat!
[Groups.Duty.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the leadership contacted the government and began openly collaborating. Not everyone was happy about this. Some stalkers broke away from the main faction and formed their own groups in different parts of the Zone. A new ""War in the Zone"" for control of everything within the perimeter is brewing."
[Groups.Duty.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! It would seem that order has finally returned to the Zone. But that could only have been an illusion from the outside. The gang's leadership is now in the hands of criminal elements. Everything is gradually descending into the most common racketeering, looting, and protection rackets. New conflicts are brewing. The gang will definitely not be able to remain united...
[Groups.Duty.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the leadership contacted the government and made some concessions to avoid conflict with the outside world. The group members generally supported this approach, as a well-studied enemy is much easier to fight. Stalkers on the ground have already experienced the first results of this cooperation: superior artifact-hunting equipment, more precise devices for identifying anomalous locations, and mutant vulnerabilities. This allowed the faction members to avoid noticing that the documents from the laboratories had been handed over to the government, and that everyone who knew about their contents had suddenly disappeared. They allegedly ""lost interest in the Zone and decided to return home."" And everyone who finds any documents in the Zone's dungeons continues to disappear to this day..."
[Groups.Duty.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, Duty contacted the government and began collaborating. Mutants were eradicated, and scientists were sent to the Zone more and more frequently. Intelligence agents were increasingly spotted in Duty, but perhaps these were just rumors...
[Groups.Duty.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Lose;Your faction has been completely destroyed. The last of the Duty members have scattered, lacking the will to fight for the ideals of Duty. Defeat!
[Groups.Duty.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The Zone is now controlled by a single faction. But recently, its priorities have shifted. For some reason, mutants are no longer being exterminated as actively. Everyone talks about money and how to make it easier... Organize a ""safari for the rich from the outside world""? Or catch a mutant for sale? Perhaps smuggle a rare artifact through the perimeter into someone's private collection? This approach to the Zone hasn't pleased everyone. Among the faction's ranks, there are those who still remember what the real Duty once was. They are gradually breaking away from the main force and occupying key points within the perimeter. Rumor has it that the Military is helping them. It's highly likely that the Zone will face new clashes with many deaths..."
[Groups.Duty.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! It would seem the war is over. The Zone is controlled by a single faction. But recently, priorities have shifted. For some reason, mutant extermination is no longer being carried out as actively. Everyone is talking about certain patrons from the north. Documents from the laboratories are disappearing in an unknown direction. Resentment is brewing among the ordinary soldiers over the strange religious speeches of their commanders. Not everyone is ready to be brainwashed by some incomprehensible sermons, especially those in the southern Zone. New contacts have already been established with the Military. And recent news about the activation of psionic installations in the north made it clear there is no turning back. A new ""War in the Zone"" is about to begin within the perimeter..."
[Groups.Duty.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the faction contacted the government and began collaborating. Things were proceeding slowly, despite pressure from the outside world. Mutants were still being eradicated, artifacts were being sought, scientists were being protected. But everything seemed to be taking its time. Some people got the impression that the higher-ups were in no hurry to combat the Zone's manifestations. Some claimed that the higher-ups were stalling because they were trying to enrich themselves as much as possible, while others said the faction's leaders did not want to lose the power they had. There was virtually no discontent among the rank-and-file soldiers, as no one was being deprived of their livelihoods, but the ideologically charged commanders began plotting a coup?
[Groups.Duty.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the faction's leadership began to increasingly shift the focus of its propaganda. Searching for artifacts and collaborating with the government and scientists became commonplace. The Zone was free of bandits, and any racketeering was nipped in the bud, making money in the Zone somewhat easier. But the government, while not particularly conflicting with the faction's leadership, was still plotting to take control of the Zone...
[Groups.Duty.Unknow].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, Duty contacted the government and began collaborating. Mutants were eradicated, and scientists were sent to the Zone more and more frequently. Intelligence agents were increasingly spotted in Duty, but perhaps these were just rumors...
[Groups.Duty.Unknow].Text-End-Standart-Lose;Your faction has been completely destroyed. The last of the Duty members have scattered, lacking the will to fight for the ideals of Duty. Defeat!
[Groups.Duty.Zombie].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Now O-Consciousness is safe. Soon, psi-radiation covered the entire Zone thanks to the increased number of emitters. Even the Cordon became dangerous. The government, although didn't release mutants from the Zone, no longer tried to retake it...

[Groups.freedom.:main].Description;"Freedom is an anarchist faction that is hostile to government forces and research teams. Some analysts believe that this faction's location at the Army Depots location is ""between a rock and a hard place,"" but their experienced, well-armed soldiers can hold their own against any faction."
[Groups.freedom.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;Well, man, get ready! We're coming for you and your boys.
[Groups.freedom.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;Dude, maybe we should make peace?
[Groups.freedom.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;Dude, how about a union? What do you think?
[Groups.freedom.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;Dude, sorry, but our paths diverge.
[Groups.freedom.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;Hi, man! Freedom needs some spare cash... Could you throw us a sum of this amount:

[Groups.freedom.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Defeat by event flag!
[Groups.freedom.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the Zone was declared a free quasi-state. The head of the SBU turned gray from the news published in the media. Secret documents discovered by the Freedom faction in the Zone's laboratories became publicly available. Now the whole world knows what happened in the Zone and how it came to be!
[Groups.freedom.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Lose;Your faction has been completely destroyed. The last of the Freedom soldiers have scattered, lacking the will to fight for the ideals of Freedom. Defeat!
[Groups.freedom.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! It would seem the war is over. The Zone is controlled by a single faction. But not long ago, its ideology changed. And to one opposed by its founders. Even before the war ended, disagreements were brewing among the commanders. It seems a new ""War in the Zone"" is brewing, one that will be purely ideological..."
[Groups.freedom.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Despite the capture of all territories, the situation hasn't stabilized. Many soldiers are dissatisfied with the current situation. Rumors are circulating that government forces are working among the leadership, as it was announced that several key territories, including the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself, have been transferred to military control. Commanders have already refused to obey orders from their superiors and are forming a unified resistance network. It appears a new phase of the ""War in the Zone"" is approaching..."
[Groups.freedom.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The Zone was soon declared a free quasi-state. But the faction's recent shift toward criminal activity has led to renewed chaos in the Zone. Within a week, a struggle for power and influence began. This led to new mass battles throughout the exclusion zone. The military has already prepared plans to take key locations, and assaults are about to begin. A new ""War in the Zone"" is already beginning..."
[Groups.freedom.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the leadership contacted the government and made some concessions to avoid conflict with the outside world. The faction members generally supported this approach, as a well-studied enemy is much easier to fight. Stalkers on the ground have already experienced the first results of this cooperation: superior artifact-hunting equipment, more precise devices for identifying anomalous locations, and mutant vulnerabilities. This allowed the faction members to avoid noticing that the documents from the laboratories had been handed over to the government, and that everyone who knew about their contents had suddenly disappeared. They allegedly ""lost interest in the Zone and decided to return home."" And everyone who finds any documents in the Zone's dungeons continues to disappear to this day..."
[Groups.freedom.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the Zone was declared a free quasi-state. The head of the SBU turned gray from the news published in the media.

[Groups.freedom.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The Zone is now controlled by a single faction. But recently, its priorities have shifted. Everyone's talking about money and how to make it easier... Organize a ""safari for the rich from the outside world""? Or catch a mutant for sale? Perhaps smuggle a rare artifact through the perimeter into someone's private collection? This approach to the Zone hasn't pleased everyone. Among the group's ranks, there are those who still remember what true Freedom once was. They are gradually breaking away from the main force and occupying key points within the perimeter. It's highly likely that the Zone will face new clashes, with many deaths..."
[Groups.freedom.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! It would seem the war is over. The Zone is controlled by a single faction. But recently, priorities have shifted. Everyone is talking about certain patrons from the north. Documents from the laboratories are disappearing into obscurity. Resentment is brewing among the ordinary soldiers over the strange religious speeches of their commanders. Not everyone is ready to be brainwashed by some incomprehensible sermons, especially those in the southern Zone. And recent news about the activation of psionic installations in the north made it clear there is no turning back. A new ""War in the Zone"" is about to begin within the perimeter..."
[Groups.freedom.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the faction began leaking information about the Zone to the media. But the Zone's unveiling to the world proceeded extremely slowly and deliberately. Some were under the impression that the elite were in no hurry to fight the government. Some claimed they were stalling because they were trying to enrich themselves as much as possible, while others said the group's leaders didn't want to lose the power they held, and still others claimed the leader had caved in to the government's demands. There was virtually no discontent among the rank-and-file soldiers, as no one was being deprived of their livelihoods, but the ideologically charged commanders began plotting a coup.
[Groups.freedom.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the Zone was declared a free quasi-state. But unlike Freedom's original goal of uncovering the Zone's secrets, the current objectives, following a recent shift in priorities, somehow bypassed these secrets. Not entirely. Several scandals were guaranteed for the government following the media publication. After this, the government increased pressure on the faction's leadership, leading to a split. The once united faction fragmented into dozens of smaller ones. However, this did not lead to a new war, only to a few minor conflicts. The military, deciding this was their chance, began preparations for a new operation to seize key locations in the Zone. Will the fragmented group be able to defend its territory? It remains to be seen...
[Groups.freedom.Unknow].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the Zone was declared a free quasi-state. The head of the SBU turned gray from the news published in the media.

[Groups.scientists.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Government forces, led by civilians, have taken control of the entire exclusion zone and are now rapidly restoring order.

[Groups.scientists.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government had taken control of the Zone, but local commanders were increasingly wary of respecting the chain of command. Rotation wasn't helping. The SBU reported some element of sectarianism among the commanders, but they couldn't investigate further. The commanders skillfully covered their tracks. So much so that even the O-Consciousness mentioned in the recovered documents was never found...

[Groups.soldiers.:main].Description;The Military is the state force within the Zone. They consider all living things within the perimeter to be their enemies, except for the Ecologists. They have excellent equipment for fighting any stalkers, but are ill-equipped to deal with the Zone's anomalous creatures.
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;Your presence in the Zone is now considered illegal. If caught, you'll be shot on the spot!
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;Command believes we need to reduce operational activity. How about a ceasefire?
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;Command believes we need an ally in the Zone to conduct operations. Do you agree?
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;We will no longer cooperate!
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;The government requires financial assistance for a new mansion for the general... Ahem. For... For the performance of special tasks in this amount. Can you help?
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-0-Down;We'll grind you into dust!
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;How else should this be understood?
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-No;No, we cannot turn a blind eye to your presence in the Zone.
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Yes;Okay, we'll turn a blind eye to your presence in the Zone...
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-No;No, we cannot turn a blind eye to your presence in the Zone.
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-Yes;The army needs an ally in the Zone. Okay, we agree.
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-No;No, we do not provide financial assistance!
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-Yes;Yes,our management has agreed to help you with finances.
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-No;Refused? Well... That was a mistake!
[Groups.soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-Yes;Excellent, it?s good that you agreed!

[Groups.soldiers.:main].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. You have been demoted. Defeat!
[Groups.soldiers.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Defeat by event flag!
[Groups.soldiers.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone, and as soon as it reviewed the documents from the laboratories, it decided to immediately classify everything. But some of the documentation somehow ended up in the public's hands. Weapons, human experiments, the reason for the Zone's creation... Now much of this has become public knowledge...
[Groups.soldiers.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone, and as soon as they reviewed the documents from the laboratories, they decided to immediately classify everything. Weapons, human experiments, the reason for the Zone's existence... Now it will forever remain a secret... The new priority became the destruction of any manifestations of the Zone. The main target: mutants. Special teams armed with shotguns and flamethrowers were formed to exterminate any creature, even small rats. Eliminating the anomalous manifestations of the Zone is the new government order that must be carried out.
[Groups.soldiers.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory!

[Groups.soldiers.Control].Text-End-Standart-Lose;There are no military personnel left in the Zone... Now it's unknown how things will end without government forces. You are demoted for failure! Defeat!
[Groups.soldiers.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone. But corruption and neglect flourished. For some reason, there wasn't enough ammunition for raids against mutants, either because it was unusable or because the necessary supplies were out of stock. The perimeter guards weren't guarding, but rather collecting bribes to transport prohibited items, like artifacts. It's unclear what this lack of attention to the Zone will lead to, but it's unlikely to be anything good.
[Groups.soldiers.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Government forces had taken control of the entire exclusion zone and were now rapidly restoring order. Ensuring the safety of research teams became a new priority. Various small units of special forces soldiers were formed for operations in particularly dangerous conditions. This was the name given to the underground complexes and laboratories, which, to the generals' surprise, turned out to be several times larger than initially anticipated. All information obtained was quickly classified, and the public knew only what the government told them about the Zone.

[Groups.soldiers.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The government took control of the Zone. They decided not only to fight the Zone but also to secretly profit from it.

[Groups.stalkers.:main].Name;Free Stalkers
[Groups.stalkers.:main].Description;Free Stalkers lack a clear hierarchy and leader. Their predisposition to searching for artifacts can be considered an advantage, which can have a positive impact on their financial situation in capable hands. However, the territories under their control are scattered across locations, making them very difficult to maintain. The faction needs to prioritize its development.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;We declare war on you!
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;It's time to end this carnage, we are ready for peace, and you?
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;We want to form an alliance with you. Do you agree?
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;We are dissolving the union!
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;We're having some financial difficulties. We could use some help. We're looking for a sum of money like this:
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-0-Down;What a rat you are! If it's war, let's have war!
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;So be it.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-No;At the moment we don't see any need for this.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Yes;Yes, we agree to a ceasefire.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-No;We're not sure we need it right now.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-Yes;Yes, we agree to cooperate.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-No;Unfortunately, we are currently unable to provide such assistance.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-Yes;Okay, we will transfer this amount to you.
[Groups.stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-No;It's a pity that you refused!

[Groups.stalkers.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Defeat by event flag!
[Groups.stalkers.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, a unified stalker faction developed a set of rules similar to those of the Freedom group, but with some clear differences. The emphasis was on money, not the idea. After some time, ""separate"" interest groups began to form within the faction, leading to a schism at the top. Many began to talk about the imminent beginning of a new phase of the ""War in the Zone""..."
[Groups.stalkers.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, a unified stalker group developed a set of rules similar to those of the Duty faction, but without the military slant. Not everyone liked this, but dissent remained silent, as the new leadership fought tooth and nail against any manifestations of the Zone, allowing for safer collection of artifacts and freedom from bandits. Mutant hunting was rigorously implemented, so much so that even blind dogs were unseen in the south. The faction's command actively collaborated with the Scientists and tried to avoid conflict with the Military, leading to a new phase of exploration of the Zone, but its secrets were extremely reluctantly revealed to the public.
[Groups.stalkers.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the stalkers developed a set of rules designed to establish order in the Zone. Even military ranks replaced ranks. No trace remained of the old command chaos. A clear system of subordination and command was established; newcomers to the Zone were forcibly integrated into this hierarchy, and those who disagreed were immediately handed over to the Military Abroad without further ado. Rumors circulated that members of the military leadership were at the top of the faction, but no one could prove it. Or perhaps they never had time to publish evidence because the Military took them to an unknown location. The Zone became less open but safer, especially for government organizations."
[Groups.stalkers.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the stalkers established a rule that there would be only one group in the Zone, with each person obligated to pay a share, and a tax was collected from traders. Those who couldn't pay were handed over to the military beyond the border. The Zone became less open to government scrutiny, and the criminal nature of the situation reduced the influx of new people into the territory protected by the stalkers.
[Groups.stalkers.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, a faction of freelance stalkers began actively collaborating with all the scientists within the Zone. Obtaining mutant body parts, artifacts, measuring anomalous activity... Everyone began making a living this way. A real hunt began for any documents from the underground laboratories. It wasn't enough just to obtain them... They also had to somehow get these papers to the nearest Scientists' bunker. And the fact that there were now an order of magnitude more bunkers didn't help. Bounty hunters are the new scourge of the Zone. If anyone found out that a stalker had even a single piece of paper from the lab, or, at worst, an item even remotely valuable to the scientists... They could easily be written off as dead. They wouldn't reach any bunker. People in the Zone split into two groups - those who extracted things, and those who hunted down those who had managed to obtain anything. There was gunfire everywhere. Gradually, the Zone became more and more dangerous...
[Groups.stalkers.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, free stalkers established a rule that there would no longer be any gangs in the Zone, and those who decided to engage in banditry were handed over to the military abroad. The Zone became open to anyone who wanted to explore. And less dangerous.
[Groups.stalkers.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The loners have been completely wiped out, and now the Zone will be divided only between factions. There are no free stalkers left! Defeat!
[Groups.stalkers.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the faction of freelance stalkers began to resemble ordinary mercenaries more and more. The clear hierarchy was crumbling, the group was fragmenting. ""Orders"" began to rule the current order. Murders became so frequent that the Zone became filled with ""professional killers."" But while people squabbled among themselves for the money they so dearly loved, the Zone became much more dangerous, as the monsters were paid far less attention than they should have been. Rumors were swirling that several new, previously unknown, and extremely dangerous monsters had already been sighted in the Cordon."
[Groups.stalkers.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the faction of free stalkers began to resemble a cult more and more. Rumors circulated among the lower ranks that the ""top brass"" were under the influence of ""certain forces from the north."" Religious phrases increasingly appeared in the commanders' speeches. Active military operations were underway against government forces to expand their influence beyond the perimeter. Brainwashing of the faction members intensified with each passing day, but some remained resilient and protected their minds. Most of them remained in the south, as they were immune to the psionic installations that had been reactivated. A new phase of the ""War in the Zone"" was brewing..."
[Groups.stalkers.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the faction of free stalkers, lacking external enemies, began to look for them within themselves. Intrigues, scandals, executions... This is what the faction had become. The stalkers' tasks devolved to guarding and clearing the main routes in the Zone, while outlying areas received virtually no attention. This led to an increase in the number of mutants and those who fled there to escape all this internal squabbling. The faction cooperated with the Scientists and the Military, but reluctantly, which led government forces to consider establishing a new base within the perimeter, which could lead to new clashes within the Zone's perimeter...
[Groups.stalkers.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, free stalkers established a rule that there would no longer be any gangs in the Zone, and those who decided to engage in banditry were handed over to the military abroad.
