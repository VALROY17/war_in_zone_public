[Tutorial.Page-1].Text;Greetings, stalker! This is the eighth (and final) part of the tutorial. In it, I'll introduce you to the faction's deputy leaders, ideologies, and internal rules. To go to the next page, click the green arrows below (you can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard).
[Tutorial.Page-2].Text;"Deputies, ideologies, and rules are closely intertwined. You don't need to delve into this to win on the easy difficulty level in most single-player scenarios. But when playing on Master or in multiplayer, it's essential, as this theme allows you to collect a ton of bonuses and also use ""automatic artifact collection."" And auto-collection is a very convenient feature. You check a box, and your soldiers automatically search for artifacts and replenish their inventory with them."
[Tutorial.Page-3].Text;"I suggest starting with the faction leader's deputies. You're the leader, but you often need an assistant. This assistant can have both advantages and disadvantages. Choose wisely. You can view a list of all available deputies for the current turn by clicking the ""Deputies"" button in the ""Additional Information"" window, which can be opened by clicking the ""Additional"" button at the top of the screen (Mark #1)."
[Tutorial.Page-4].Text;More about the bonuses. They can influence many aspects of the faction. For example, they can assist in reconnaissance or counterrecon, reduce the cost of changing the location of the faction's main base, and so on. But among the various bonuses, there are parameters linked to ideology. One of them indicates the character's ideology, and the second indicates the percentage of the turn by which they will try to increase it in the faction if appointed as a deputy. You can view your faction's current ideology by clicking on any of your territories on the map and hovering the cursor over the image to the right of your faction's logo (Mark #1). All information about your ideology will be there: name, bonuses, and its impact on the faction's internal rules.
[Tutorial.Page-5].Text;And in the same window, when you hover over the portrait of the group leader (it?s under the group logo), you can find out what ideology the leader of the faction preaches and what bonuses he gives to his leadership (Mark No. 1).
[Tutorial.Page-6].Text;"A deputy's ideology may differ from the leader's. Here, it's important to consider who is the stronger advocate. Usually, it's the deputy. If such a deputy is appointed, after a certain number of turns, the influence of their ideology will become significant, and internal conflicts may arise within the faction. More precisely, when the current faction ideology drops below 50%, soldiers will begin to leave. At first, the number of defections will be small, but then, as the current ideology percentage drops even lower, they will begin to leave in large numbers! Therefore, it's crucial to monitor the ideology percentage in the corresponding window when appointing a deputy with an ideology different from the current one. To do this, simply click the ""Ideologies"" button (Mark #1) in the same additional information window. It's also possible that a deputy is appointed with an ideology that isn't listed in this window. This is not a problem. If you click ""End Turn,"" the deputy's ideology will appear in the ideology window on the next turn. This means that no one previously adhered to it."
[Tutorial.Page-7].Text;The window with the current ideology percentage has a button that allows you to change it, but the price in CR can be quite large. There are two ways to reduce the price. The first is to purchase upgrades (Mark #1), which reduce the price in CR. The second is to simply wait a few more turns, during which time the appointed deputy with the desired ideology will increase the percentage of people who adhere to their ideology. The ideal approach is to use both methods simultaneously.
[Tutorial.Page-8].Text;"You might be wondering, ""Why change your ideology at all?"" Let me answer... Changing your ideology not only changes your faction logo, but also changes the inventory of your faction's merchant, influences the ending of most scenarios, and changes the list of available faction management rules. This may seem insignificant at first, but it can actually have a significant impact at crucial moments in the game. For example, for the Military faction, you can enable automatic artifact search rules this way, significantly reducing the cost of CR spent on artifact searches. This is extremely useful when there are many territories and few CRs available for searches."
[Tutorial.Page-9].Text;"Now I'll tell you about the faction's internal rules. I've mentioned them several times before. To access the rules window, simply click the ""Rules"" button in the additional information window (Label #1)."
[Tutorial.Page-10].Text;Each ideology has its own set of rules in the first row. The rule selected here influences which column of rules (below it) will be available. For example, if the third rule in the first row is selected, the entire third column of rules will become available for selection. The rows divide the rules into themes. The first is the control method, the second is the attitude toward artifact search, the third is reconnaissance, and the fourth is combat. To enable the recon network rule (row 3, column 5), which provides significant recon bonuses (but will reduce counterintelligence performance), you must enable rule #5 in the first row. And to enable simple automatic artifact search (row 2, column 2), you must switch to rule #2 in the first row. The recon network will then be marked with a yellow checkmark. This means the rule still works, but it's unavailable for re-selection because rule #2 is selected in the first line, not #5. So, after you've selected everything you need in the lower lines of rules, you can change the value in the first line to whatever you want, and everything will work. But, again, the list of rules available in the first line depends on the faction's ideology. By the way, no one stops you from changing your ideology and rules several times to collect all the best rules and their bonuses, and then returning to your original ideology. This way, you can collect all the best bonuses!
[Tutorial.Page-11].Text;"In this scenario, you can try switching your current ideology to ""Fight the Zone."" To do this, appoint a deputy with this ideology. Next, purchase upgrades to reduce the cost of switching your ideology and wait for the appropriate cost to change your ideology by skipping a turn. To successfully complete the tutorial, capture all territories owned by Bandits and Military in this location. Don't worry, as this is a tutorial, the enemy is significantly weakened and won't put up much of a fight, and you'll be able to master all the material covered in all parts of the tutorial! Once you've captured what you need and confirmed your progress by clicking ""End Turn,"" the tutorial will conclude with your victory."

[Groups.Bandits.:main].Name;Bandits
[Groups.Bandits.:main].Description;Bandits are the criminal element of the Zone. They control significant territories further south. Despite their favorable location, defending them won't be easy, as they are in conflict with virtually everyone. They lack adequate weapons and a large number of skilled soldiers within their ranks. The faction needs to reorganize, both internally and externally.
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;Well, what now, chump, had enough? Pull your piece out! The boys are already on their way!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;Hey, hey! Easy there, bro, yeah? Maybe we stop blasting each other, huh? Deal?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;Hey, bro, how about we team up, yeah? Like? shoot some suckers together? that kinda thing. Huh? Deal?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;Nah, you're a real punk, straight-up loser. From here on, every man for himself!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;Hey, you hear me, pal, got any spare change? Just a bit, like this much:
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-0-Down;Who the hell are you mouthing off to? Big man, you're dead, got it?!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;Man, that was just pathetic as hell?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-No;We find you - we'll skin you alive!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Yes;Listen up, we won't touch you. For real, I swear on my word!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-No;No, no, that's total crap, you're talking nonsense!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-Yes;Hang in there, buddy, everything's gonna be fine?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-No;You hit your head or what? Where would we get that kinda cash? We could use it ourselves?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-Yes;Here, bro, take the cash!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-No;Bro? you really screwed up. You shouldn't have done that?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-Yes;Well damn, bro, you made my day! Nice one?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-No;Bro? you really messed up. Shouldn't have done that?
[Groups.Bandits.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-Yes;Oh hell yeah, bro! Now we'll be popping chumps together!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].Text-End-Step-Victory;You survived! Victory!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Victory;Victory by event flag!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The faction has been completely destroyed, now the Zone will be divided between other factions. Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction's behavior soon became less and less like its original form. Yes, there was still crime, but it was diminishing. The elite tried to promote a theme close to that advocated by the ""Freedom"" faction, while the lower ranks were slow to embrace these new ideals, as the old methods of robbery and looting seemed simpler and more understandable. The group was splintering before our eyes. Every new day brought new instances of disobedience by individual groups. A new conflict in the Zone was about to begin..."
[Groups.Bandits.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The gang's behavior soon became less and less like its original self. The criminal element diminished significantly. The leadership increasingly pushed the idea of ??fighting the Zone. Yes, many understood that there was no one left to rob, everyone was part of the faction, and they agreed. But since the gang also included real criminals, separate groups formed to rob those same ""their own."" Localized fighting broke out all around. The Zone once again found itself on the brink of a full-scale war of all against all..."
[Groups.Bandits.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction's behavior soon became less and less like its original form. Crime levels dropped significantly. A strict hierarchy was established. The name ""Penal Battalion"" best described the situation. Rumors circulated among the faction's members that the top brass had caved in to the government's influence. Many accepted this, but there were also those in power with the ""big shots"" who disagreed with this arrangement. A new, large-scale conflict was brewing, this time within the group..."
[Groups.Bandits.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The Zone had become a criminal quasi-state. The Zone began to live by its own rules. Soon, there was no one left to rob, and the gang became mired in infighting. Instead of shooting monsters and looting artifacts, the Bandits started shooting at each other...
[Groups.Bandits.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The last bandit got the bullet. There's no more room for the criminal underworld in the Zone... Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Crime].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up. The boys say you're no good... Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction controls the entire territory. There's no one left to rob. Soon, there'll be nowhere left to loot either... The top brass is already actively switching to lucrative contracts from the government. Groups of Scientists can now often be seen in the Zone taking their animal activity measurements under the watchful eye of local ""brothers."" Yesterday's bandits were already out and about, doing what they once considered too dirty - searching for artifacts, extracting mutant body parts, and taking obscure measurements with equally obscure instruments. Not everyone liked this, so isolated groups emerged who organized attacks on ""their own."" They tried to actively combat them, but more and more of these ""dissenters"" appeared, as few found their place in the new reality of studying the Zone..."
[Groups.Bandits.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The Zone had become a criminal quasi-state. The Zone began to live by its own rules. Soon, there was no one left to rob, and the gang became mired in infighting. Instead of shooting monsters and looting artifacts, the Bandits started shooting at each other...
[Groups.Bandits.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The last bandit got the bullet. There's no more room for the criminal underworld in the Zone... Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Growth].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up. The boys say you're no good... Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The faction controls the entire territory. There's no one left to rob. Soon, there will be no more room for looting either... The leadership is already actively switching to lucrative contracts from the outside world. But the emphasis was on more criminal contracts, so Scientists, guarded by local soldiers, were practically nonexistent in the Zone, significantly limiting exploration of the Zone. The government planned to launch several military operations to retake key Zone facilities. Soon there will be a ""War in the Zone"" again..."
[Groups.Bandits.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! But despite the fact that the faction had occupied all territories, there was no such control over its forces. Confusion reigned all around. Strange speeches from the leadership, strange behavior from everyone in the northern Zone, the psionic installations soon being turned on again... All this worried those in the south. The south began arming itself and forming its own hierarchy with commanders. A new phase of the ""War in the Zone"" was about to begin..."
[Groups.Bandits.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The group controls the entire territory. There's no one left to plunder. Soon, there will be no more room to loot either... The leadership is actively trying to find new ways to enrich themselves. The soldiers began to be divided into subgroups. Some search for artifacts, others hunt for mutant body parts, and still others are used as mercenaries to carry out external contracts. But there were also those for whom any of the ""peaceful"" trades were unsuitable. The first conflicts and subsequent fighting soon began. The group's internal hierarchy was in turmoil, and it was unclear how it would all end..."
[Groups.Bandits.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The faction soon behaved less and less like its original self. Crime had truly diminished. Pay your share, and you can go and get artifacts. No one should interfere. And if someone does, they'll find those guys. Find them quickly. But if they find patrons high up, they'll let them go with a few words of warning. So, within the faction, separate groups with their own leaders quickly formed, dragging the group toward armed internal conflict...
[Groups.Bandits.Unknow].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The Zone had become a criminal quasi-state. The Zone began to live by its own rules. Soon, there was no one left to rob, and the gang became mired in infighting. Instead of shooting monsters and looting artifacts, the Bandits started shooting at each other...
[Groups.Bandits.Unknow].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The last bandit got the bullet. There's no more room for the criminal underworld in the Zone... Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Unknow].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up. The boys say you're no good... Defeat!
[Groups.Bandits.Zombie].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Now O-Consciousness is safe. Soon, psi-radiation covered the entire Zone thanks to the increased number of emitters. Even the Cordon became dangerous. The government, although didn't release mutants from the Zone, no longer tried to retake it...

[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Spy3-Name;Veteran
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Spy4-Name;Master
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Name;Military
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Description;The Military is the state force within the Zone. They consider all living things within the perimeter to be their enemies, except for the Ecologists. They have excellent equipment for fighting any stalkers, but are ill-equipped to deal with the Zone's anomalous creatures.
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;Your presence in the Zone is now considered illegal. If caught, you'll be shot on the spot!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;Command believes we need to reduce operational activity. How about a ceasefire?
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;Command believes we need an ally in the Zone to conduct operations. Do you agree?
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;We will no longer cooperate!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;The government requires financial assistance for a new mansion for the general... Ahem. For... For the performance of special tasks in this amount. Can you help?
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-0-Down;We'll grind you into dust!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;How else should this be understood?
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-No;No, we cannot turn a blind eye to your presence in the Zone.
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Yes;Okay, we'll turn a blind eye to your presence in the Zone...
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-No;No, we cannot turn a blind eye to your presence in the Zone.
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-Yes;The army needs an ally in the Zone. Okay, we agree.
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-No;No, we do not provide financial assistance!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-Yes;Yes,our management has agreed to help you with finances.
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-No;Refused? Well... That was a mistake!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-Yes;Excellent, it?s good that you agreed!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-No;Refused? Well... That was a mistake!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-Yes;Excellent, it?s good that you agreed!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Text-End-Step-Victory;You survived! Victory!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Victory;Victory by event flag!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The faction was completely destroyed, now the Zone will be divided between other factions. Defeat!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. You have been demoted. Defeat!
[Groups.Soldiers.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. Defeat!
[Groups.Soldiers.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone, and as soon as it reviewed the documents from the laboratories, it decided to immediately classify everything. But some of the documentation somehow ended up in the public's hands. Weapons, human experiments, the reason for the Zone's creation... Now much of this has become public knowledge...
[Groups.Soldiers.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone, and as soon as they reviewed the documents from the laboratories, they decided to immediately classify everything. Weapons, human experiments, the reason for the Zone's existence... Now it will forever remain a secret... The new priority became the destruction of any manifestations of the Zone. The main target: mutants. Special teams armed with shotguns and flamethrowers were formed to exterminate any creature, even small rats. Eliminating the anomalous manifestations of the Zone is the new government order that must be carried out.
[Groups.Soldiers.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone, and as soon as they reviewed the documents from the laboratories, they decided to immediately classify everything. The weapons, the human experiments, the reason for the Zone's creation... Now it will remain a secret forever...
[Groups.Soldiers.Control].Text-End-Standart-Lose;There are no military personnel left in the Zone... Now it's unknown how things will end without government forces. You are demoted for failure! Defeat!
[Groups.Soldiers.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone. But corruption and neglect flourished. For some reason, there wasn't enough ammunition for raids against mutants, either because it was unusable or because the necessary supplies were out of stock. The perimeter guards weren't guarding, but rather collecting bribes to transport prohibited items, like artifacts. It's unclear what this lack of attention to the Zone will lead to, but it's unlikely to be anything good.
[Groups.Soldiers.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Government forces had taken control of the entire exclusion zone and were now rapidly restoring order. Ensuring the safety of research teams became a new priority. Various small units of special forces soldiers were formed for operations in particularly dangerous conditions. This was the name given to the underground complexes and laboratories, which, to the generals' surprise, turned out to be several times larger than initially anticipated. All information obtained was quickly classified, and the public knew only what the government told them about the Zone.
[Groups.Soldiers.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government took control of the Zone, and as soon as they reviewed the documents from the laboratories, they decided to immediately classify everything.

[Groups.Soldiers.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Government forces had taken control of the entire exclusion zone and were now rapidly restoring order. But corruption was rampant among the commanders. Some began to profit from dubious contracts with private firms. Various small detachments of soldiers formed, collecting artifacts and capturing mutants for private ""collectors."" Service or money? This was the question everyone was asking themselves..."
[Groups.Soldiers.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! The government had taken control of the Zone, but local commanders were increasingly wary of respecting the chain of command. Rotation wasn't helping. The SBU reported some element of sectarianism among the commanders, but they couldn't investigate further. The commanders skillfully covered their tracks. So much so that even the O-Consciousness mentioned in the recovered documents was never found...
[Groups.Soldiers.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Government forces had managed to take control of the entire exclusion zone and were now rapidly restoring order. Various small units of special forces soldiers were formed for operations in particularly dangerous conditions. This was the name given to the underground complexes and laboratories, which, to the generals' surprise, turned out to be several times larger than initially anticipated. All information obtained was quickly classified, and the public knew only what the government told them about the Zone.
[Groups.Soldiers.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! The government took control of the Zone. They decided not only to fight the Zone but also to secretly profit from it. Several secret squads of military stalkers were formed to search for particularly valuable artifacts, which were then sold on the black market abroad to enrich certain elites. This is how the so-called ""artifact oligarchs"" subsequently emerged..."

[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Name;Loners
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Description;Loners lack a clear hierarchy and leader. Their predisposition to searching for artifacts can be considered an advantage, which can have a positive impact on their financial situation in capable hands. However, the territories under their control are scattered across locations, making them very difficult to maintain. The faction needs to prioritize its development.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-War;We declare war on you!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral;It's time to end this carnage, we are ready for peace, and you?
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance;We want to form an alliance with you. Do you agree?
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-BreakAlliance;We are dissolving the union!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ask;We're having some financial difficulties. We could use some help. We're looking for a sum of money like this:
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-0-Down;What a rat you are! If it's war, let's have war!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Down;So be it.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-No;At the moment we don't see any need for this.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-1-Yes;Yes, we agree to a ceasefire.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-No;We're not sure we need it right now.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Ans-2-Yes;Yes, we agree to cooperate.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-No;Unfortunately, we are currently unable to provide such assistance.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-RequestMoney-Ans-Yes;Okay, we will transfer this amount to you.
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-No;It's a pity that you refused!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Neutral-Yes;Good! We're glad you agree!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-No;It's a pity that you refused!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].DiplomacyText-Question-Alliance-Yes;Good! We're glad you agree!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Text-End-Step-Victory;You survived! Victory!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Victory;Victory by event flag!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The faction was completely destroyed, now the Zone will be divided between other factions. Defeat!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Text-End-Step-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. Defeat!
[Groups.Stalkers.:main].Text-End-EventFlag-Lose;Time's up, you failed to gain control of the Zone. Defeat!
[Groups.Stalkers.Anarchy].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, a unified stalker faction developed a set of rules similar to those of the Freedom group, but with some clear differences. The emphasis was on money, not the idea. After some time, ""separate"" interest groups began to form within the faction, leading to a schism at the top. Many began to talk about the imminent beginning of a new phase of the ""War in the Zone""..."
[Groups.Stalkers.AntiZone].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, a unified stalker group developed a set of rules similar to those of the Duty faction, but without the military slant. Not everyone liked this, but dissent remained silent, as the new leadership fought tooth and nail against any manifestations of the Zone, allowing for safer collection of artifacts and freedom from bandits. Mutant hunting was rigorously implemented, so much so that even blind dogs were unseen in the south. The faction's command actively collaborated with the Scientists and tried to avoid conflict with the Military, leading to a new phase of exploration of the Zone, but its secrets were extremely reluctantly revealed to the public.
[Groups.Stalkers.Control].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the stalkers developed a set of rules designed to establish order in the Zone. Even military ranks replaced ranks. No trace remained of the old command chaos. A clear system of subordination and command was established; newcomers to the Zone were forcibly integrated into this hierarchy, and those who disagreed were immediately handed over to the Military Abroad without further ado. Rumors circulated that members of the military leadership were at the top of the faction, but no one could prove it. Or perhaps they never had time to publish evidence because the Military took them to an unknown location. The Zone became less open but safer, especially for government organizations."
[Groups.Stalkers.Crime].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the stalkers established a rule that there would be only one group in the Zone, with each person obligated to pay a share, and a tax was collected from traders. Those who couldn't pay were handed over to the military beyond the border. The Zone became less open to government scrutiny, and the criminal nature of the situation reduced the influx of new people into the territory protected by the stalkers.
[Groups.Stalkers.Exploring].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, a faction of freelance stalkers began actively collaborating with all the scientists within the Zone. Obtaining mutant body parts, artifacts, measuring anomalous activity... Everyone began making a living this way. A real hunt began for any documents from the underground laboratories. It wasn't enough just to obtain them... They also had to somehow get these papers to the nearest Scientists' bunker. And the fact that there were now an order of magnitude more bunkers didn't help. Bounty hunters are the new scourge of the Zone. If anyone found out that a stalker had even a single piece of paper from the lab, or, at worst, an item even remotely valuable to the scientists... They could easily be written off as dead. They wouldn't reach any bunker. People in the Zone split into two groups - those who extracted things, and those who hunted down those who had managed to obtain anything. There was gunfire everywhere. Gradually, the Zone became more and more dangerous...
[Groups.Stalkers.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, free stalkers established a rule that there would no longer be any gangs in the Zone, and those who decided to engage in banditry were handed over to the military abroad. The Zone became open to anyone who wanted to explore. And less dangerous.
[Groups.Stalkers.Growth].Text-End-Standart-Lose;The loners have been completely wiped out, and now the Zone will be divided only between factions. There are no free stalkers left! Defeat!
[Groups.Stalkers.Mercenary].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the faction of freelance stalkers began to resemble ordinary mercenaries more and more. The clear hierarchy was crumbling, the group was fragmenting. ""Orders"" began to rule the current order. Murders became so frequent that the Zone became filled with ""professional killers."" But while people squabbled among themselves for the money they so dearly loved, the Zone became much more dangerous, as the monsters were paid far less attention than they should have been. Rumors were swirling that several new, previously unknown, and extremely dangerous monsters had already been sighted in the Cordon."
[Groups.Stalkers.Sectarianism].Text-End-Standart-Victory;"Victory! Soon, the faction of free stalkers began to resemble a cult more and more. Rumors circulated among the lower ranks that the ""top brass"" were under the influence of ""certain forces from the north."" Religious phrases increasingly appeared in the commanders' speeches. Active military operations were underway against government forces to expand their influence beyond the perimeter. Brainwashing of the faction members intensified with each passing day, but some remained resilient and protected their minds. Most of them remained in the south, as they were immune to the psionic installations that had been reactivated. A new phase of the ""War in the Zone"" was brewing..."
[Groups.Stalkers.Stability].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory! Soon, the faction of free stalkers, lacking external enemies, began to look for them within themselves. Intrigues, scandals, executions... This is what the faction had become. The stalkers' tasks devolved to guarding and clearing the main routes in the Zone, while outlying areas received virtually no attention. This led to an increase in the number of mutants and those who fled there to escape all this internal squabbling. The faction cooperated with the Scientists and the Military, but reluctantly, which led government forces to consider establishing a new base within the perimeter, which could lead to new clashes within the Zone's perimeter...
[Groups.Stalkers.Stalkers].Text-End-Standart-Victory;Victory!

Even the Cordon became dangerous. The government, although didn't release mutants from the Zone, no longer tried to retake it...
